# About Me
My name is Amitai, and I'm a Threat Researcher at [Wiz](https://www.wiz.io/), where I investigate cloud threats and work to advance research and detection methodology.
My background is in cyber threat intelligence analyst and writing, and I enjoy contemplating philosophy of science, marveling at new technology and gadgets, and appreciating video games.
