# About Me
My name is Amitai and I'm a Threat Researcher at [Wiz](https://www.wiz.io/) (a cloud security company), where I investigate cloud threats and work to advance research and detection methodology.
My background is in cyber threat intelligence analysis and writing, and I generally enjoy learning new things about science and technology, making diagrams to help me better understand these things (currently using the wonderful [Excalidraw](https://excalidraw.com/) to do so), contemplating the philosophy of science (and cyber), reading science fiction and fantasy (or diving into wiki rabbit holes), and marveling at gadgets.
