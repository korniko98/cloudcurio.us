# About Me
My name is Amitai and I'm a Threat Researcher at [Wiz](https://www.wiz.io/) (a cloud security company), where I investigate cloud threats and work to advance research and detection methodology.
My background is in cyber threat intelligence analysis and writing, and I generally enjoy learning new things about science and technology, making diagrams to help me better understand these things (currently using the wonderful [Excalidraw](https://excalidraw.com/) to do so), contemplating the philosophy of science (and cyber), reading science fiction and fantasy (or diving into wiki rabbit holes), and marveling at gadgets.

## Projects
* [cloudvulndb.org](https://www.cloudvulndb.org/) (also on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/cloudvulndb) and [Mastodon](https://infosec.exchange/@cloudvulndb)) - an open repository and website set up with the goal of listing all known cloud vulnerabilities and cloud service provider security issues (all the art is made with [midjourney](https://www.midjourney.com/)).
* [Rhythms of Research](https://amitaico.substack.com/) - essays on research methodology and the creation process of finished intelligence products (mainly from a cyber threat intel perspective, but I try to generalize).
* [hog.net](https://korniko98.github.io/hog.net/) - a "Harry Potter" themed querying exercise for research training.
